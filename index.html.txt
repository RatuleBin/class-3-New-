Hi Saki,

Good morning! Hope you are doing well.

Today, I had a chance to check the itcloudglobal.com website again, but I see there are still issues with fonts and images (See the attacheted). These issues reduce our website's brand value.

Shall I fix these issues? Please let me know.

Thanks.
